    "The problem ask us to meet the requirements of the dose and since the radiation can hurt body, we should use less beamlets as possible. Problem provides us with the dose matrix which gives the dose delivered to each voxel from each beamlet when one unit of that beamlet is used. Beamlets are from 1 to 60. Voxels are from 1 to 400. I then use the index to remember the position of different regions as below."
